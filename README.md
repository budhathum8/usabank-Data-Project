# USABank-Data-Project Analysis

This is my practice USABank-Data-Project Analysis project for the my Code:You course on "practic Python Code for data science and machine learning".
In this project, I will be doing an exploratory data analysis of stock prices through data visualization and I will be learn how to pulling up historical data from the web. This is not meant to be an analysis for us to practically apply. So, while this will be interesting and I will make observations, this analysis is not to be taken as financial advice. We must always keep in mind that past performance does not gaurentee future performance.In this project, we're going to focus on bank stocks during the COVID-19 pandemic Started from January 13th, 2020 through Decamber 31st, 2022.

**Goal:**
The dataset aims to provide hands-on experience in data pulling up from the web, preprocessing, analysis, develop visualization and summaries to communicate effectively to non-technical stakeholders within the context of banking and finance.

Steps:

   1. List key financial metrics.
   2. Determine data needed to support.
   3. Review avaliable data.
   4. Identify the type of analysis that can be done and list the auestion that can be answered.
   5. Clean the data.
   6. Analyze the data and answer the question.
   7. Visualize the analysis.

## Programming Languages

   Python Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, yfinance, cufflinks
