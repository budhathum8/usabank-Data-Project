# USABank-Data-Project Analysis

This Capstone project  for Code:You Data Analysis  course. In this project, I will be doing an exploratory data analysis of stock prices through data visualization. This is not meant to be an analysis for us to practically apply. I will make observations, this analysis is not to be taken as financial advice for any company because it's only for educational purposes.In this project, we're going to focus on bank stocks during the financial crisis.

**Goal:**
The dataset aims to provide hands-on experience in data preprocessing, analysis, develop visualization and summaries to communicate effectively to non-technical stakeholders within the context of banking and finance.

Steps:

   1. List key financial metrics.
   2. Determine data needed to support.
   3. Review avaliable data.
   4. Identify the type of analysis that can be done and list the auestion that can be answered.
   5. Clean the data.
   6. Analyze the data and answer the question.
   7. Visualize the analysis.

## Getting Started

   1. Clone this repo.
   2. Creat a virtual environment and install the packages listed in the requirements.txt file.
   3. Data Collection and Preparation
   4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   5. Visualization Layer
   6. Report Generation
